# Restaurant-sales-data-Analysis-python


## Project Overview
This project is based on the restaurant dataset, which contains information about restaurant types, ratings, approximate cost, votes, and online/offline order options.

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize:
-what type of resturant do the majority of customers order from
-how many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
- Which types of restaurants receive more orders (online/offline)
- Average spending of couples per order
- Distribution of ratings and comparison between online and offline orders
- Key trends using heatmaps, boxplots, and histograms
